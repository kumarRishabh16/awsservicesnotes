********************************************Important Questions *******************
1) AWS Cost Explorer:AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

2) AWS Cost and Usage Report:AWS Cost and Usage Reports tracks your AWS usage and provides estimated charges associated with your account

3) AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure,
 you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

4)Elastic Load Balancers: Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic
 across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.
 It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.

5) Amazon EC2 instance types: Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI) provide a significant discount (up to 72%)
 compared to On-Demand pricing and provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific Availability Zone.
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/

6) Amazon EC2 instance: On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) 
with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing,
 and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs.

7) Amazon EC2 instance: A Spot Instance is an instance that uses spare EC2 capacity that is available for less than the On-Demand price.
 Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts,
 you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price

8)AWS global infrastructure (AWS Regions):26 Launched Regions Each with multiple Availability Zones (AZ’s)
-->84 Availability Zones
-->17 Local Zones 28 Wavelength Zones For ultralow latency applications
-->8 Announced Regions 32 Announced Local Zones 
-->2x More Regions With multiple AZ’s than the next largest cloud provider
